# Event Bubbling Playground

## What is this?

A visual demo to understand how browser events travel through the DOM.

## Why does it matter?

Because clicks, scrolls, inputs, modals, dropdowns, and menus all rely on this.

## Core concepts

- Event bubbling
- event.target vs event.currentTarget
- stopPropagation
- capturing phase

## When to use

- Event delegation
- Handling clicks on lists
- Global click handlers

## Common mistakes

- Forgetting to stop propagation
- Attaching too many listeners
- Misusing target/currentTarget
